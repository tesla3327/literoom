- packages/core/src/gpu/capabilities.ts (extracted buildCapabilities and getAdapterInfo helpers to DRY detectGPUCapabilities and GPUCapabilityService.initialize)
- packages/core/src/gpu/texture-utils.ts (extracted rgbToRgba and rgbaToRgb to DRY gpu-adjustments-service, gpu-histogram-service, gpu-mask-service, and gpu-tone-curve-service)
